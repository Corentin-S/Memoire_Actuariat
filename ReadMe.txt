You need to upload the 3 files : exposures.txt, FRATNP_d_short_idr.csv and FRATNP_m_short_idr.csv.

After that, import them with R-Studio with a command-line or with the button "import Dataset" from the environment window.

The file exposures.txt need a specific delimiter option "whitespace" to correctly work.

Finally, run the entire code and wait a little bit to get results.
